## Check if you have Python installed on your machine
* Open a terminal and type the following:

```bash
python --version
```

* If you do not get any errors, this means you have Python already installed on your machine.

* In case of any errors, download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org).
    * If you are on Windows, you can download Python from the Microsoft Store.
    * Using this method, Python will be installed and managed by Microsoft Store.  This will ensure you always have the latest version of Python.
